Concept:
Display as the *NIX process title what each of your Thin servers are doing.

The idea for this was shamelessly stolen from:
http://purefiction.net/mongrel_proctitle/

You should be able to run 'ps' or 'top' on your *nix like system and see process output for your
Thin servers that looks something like this:

thin [10010/2/358]: handling 127.0.0.1: HEAD /feed/calendar/global/91/6de4
|     |     | |     |        |          |
|     |     | |     |        |          The current request (method and path)
|     |     | |     |        The client IP
|     |     | |     What it's doing
|     |     | The number of requests processed during the server's lifetime
|     |     The number of requests currently queued/being processed concurrently
|     The port that Mongrel is serving
The process name


Usage:

  Copy the thin_proctitle.ru file to RAILS_ROOT/config/thin_proctitle.ru

  Modify the following variables in this file to fit your setup:

    :root => '/your/rails/root/dir'
    :environment => 'production'

  Start your Thin server passing in the '--rackup' parameter which should look something like:

    'thin start --rackup thin_proctitle.ru'

    Tip:
      See http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/the-flexible-thin-anorexic-gymnast-that-democratized-deployment/

  If you are using a Thin .yaml file for configuration you can also specify the rackup command there:

    ...
    rackup: config/thin_proctitle.ru
    ...

Thanks:

Thanks to Marc-André Cournoyer (macournoyer) for writing Thin and for providing the sample code behind this.
